This list is used to make a TODO list.

- Shell script to setup everything in /etc/ansible
	- ... except hosts (only once; afterwards, it gets filled up with whatever)
- Playbooks/roles/variables to setup...
	- Kubernetes (maybe K3S?)
	- Database services
		- Install MySQL
			- Already a playbook to install MySQL, but need to go through secure installation:
				- https://serverfault.com/questions/1026554/how-to-do-mysql-secure-installation-via-ansible-playbook
	- VNC services (mainly for non-RPi servers) (refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1hUwxxYek)
- Fix the following error: 
	[WARNING]: Platform linux on host node02 is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python, but future installation of another Python
	interpreter could change this. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.
